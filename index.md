Notes for the course [02582](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/02582) Computational Data Analysis at the Technical University of Denmark.


These notes are written by myself ([@rasgaard](https://github.com/rasgaard/)) for personal use througout taking the course during the spring of 2022. 
I thougt that someone in the future might benefit from having access to these notes, so I thought I'd make them publicly available. 
It can also be accessed on [Notion](https://rasgaard.notion.site/Computational-Data-Analysis-524da89eb1bc4985b0b100d3a80ca71c) which was where I originally wrote everything and eventually exportede to Markdown.

Disclaimers:
1. These notes are by no means all emcopassing as I sometimes skip parts or perhaps describe things a bit too vaguely.
2. As mentioned, these were for my personal use, so don't see them as course curriculum.
3. I might have written down something completely wrong or missed a point, so read with caution.
